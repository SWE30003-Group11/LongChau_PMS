                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                  Flu symptoms include fever, body aches, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms. Unlike a cold, flu symptoms come on suddenly and are more severe. Early treatment with antiviral medications can reduce severity.

                  Not all supplements are created equal. Look for third-party tested products, check expiration dates, and choose reputable brands. Our pharmacists can help you select appropriate supplements for your needs.

                  Some vitamins are best taken with food, while others absorb better on an empty stomach. Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) should be taken with meals containing healthy fats.

                  Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health today. Understanding how to use antibiotics responsibly is crucial for preserving their effectiveness for future generations.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-12 mb-4">What is Antibiotic Resistance?</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                  Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria evolve to survive medications designed to kill them. This makes infections harder to treat and increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness, and death.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-12 mb-4">How Resistance Develops</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                  Resistance develops when antibiotics are overused or misused. Taking antibiotics for viral infections, not completing prescribed courses, or sharing antibiotics all contribute to resistance.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-12 mb-4">Using Antibiotics Responsibly</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                  Only take antibiotics prescribed for you, complete the full course even if you feel better, never share antibiotics, and don't save leftover antibiotics. Trust your healthcare provider's judgment on whether antibiotics are needed.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-12 mb-4">Prevention is Key</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
                  Preventing infections reduces the need for antibiotics. Practice good hygiene, stay up-to-date with vaccinations, handle food safely, and avoid close contact with sick people when possible.
